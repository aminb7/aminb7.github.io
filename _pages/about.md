About
======
I am Mohammad Amin Baqershahi, a computer engineering B.Sc. student in at the University of Tehran. I have been working as a research intern at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Adel Nadjaran Toosi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIh_I-gAAAAJ&hl=en) and worked on designing and implementing scheduling methods and algorithms for heterogeneous Kubernetes clusters in a way that interference of different types of applications (CPU-intensive, Memory-intensive, etc) are considered for mapping pods to resources. My final bachelor thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Naser Yazdani](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~yazdani) was in the area of IoT and more specifically about applying multiple mobile sinks in wireless sensor networks to collect data more efficiently and solve the issue of disjoint WSNs. 

My research interests include **Distributed Systems**, **Cloud Computing**, **Computer Networks**, **IoT**, and **Software Engineering**.

Currently, I'm seeking graduate positions in the field of my interest. I'd appreciate you letting me know if you are interested in working with me.
