## **About**

I am MohammadAmin Baqershahi, a computer engineering MASc student at the University of British Columbia. I work at the [Cirrus Lab](https://cirrus.ece.ubc.ca/) as a graduate research assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Mohammad Shahrad](https://mshahrad.github.io/). My main research area is Cloud Computing. Currently, I work on building the next generation of serverless computing systems aiming at optimizing resource efficiency and performance through language runtime-based isolation. Previously I worked as an undergraduate reseatch assistant at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Adel Nadjaran Toosi](https://adelnadjarantoosi.info/), focusing on Kubernetes scheduling.

Currently, I'm seeking internship opportunities in software engineering, cloud engineering, or DevOps.
