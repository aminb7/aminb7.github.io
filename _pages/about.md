About
======
I am Mohammad Amin Baqershahi, a recent BSc graduate in Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran. My final bachelor thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Naser Yazdani](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~yazdani) was implementing a new method for data dissemination in wireless sensor networks using multiple mobile sinks. Moreover, I have been working as a research intern at the [Monash university](https://www.monash.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Adel Nadjaran Toosi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIh_I-gAAAAJ&hl=en) to design and implement a new customized heterogeneity-aware scheduler for Kubernetes. I also have professional experience in software engineering as a skilled developer in the Snapp! company, one of the most prominent companies in the Middle East, and gained experience in the development of large-scale services and web APIs.

My research interests include **Distributed Systems**, **Cloud Computing**, **Computer Networks**, **IoT**, and **Software Engineering**.

Currently, I'm seeking graduate positions in the field of my interest. I'd appreciate you letting me know if you are interested in working with me.
